Description: Thousands of documents are created under the U.S. Endangered Species
    Act each year, and thousands already exist. But too many are only available
    as image-based PDFs that cannot be indexed and searched. This package
    creates the tools and a Shiny app for an Elastic-based search engine for
    ESA documents.
